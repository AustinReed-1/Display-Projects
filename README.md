Display Projects

Within this repository you will find a selection of programmes in Python, R and LaTeX. Within the WTKLAB lab folder, you will find a short selection of some code I have written and used during my work at WTKLAB (Cambridge Department of Pharmacology) analysing single cell RNA sequencing data to understand the risks and processes of early stage breast cancer formation. The data used for this belongs to the lab and most remains unpublished so I have not included those here so of course the code will unfortunately not run. The CATAM (Computer-aided teaching of all mathematics) folder contains one of my final year university projects exploring protein sequence comparisons for which I recieved full marks in (40/40). In the CUAI Workshops file you will find a convolutional neural network which shows high accuracy and precision in correctly classifying images into categories of plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck.
