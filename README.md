Display Projects

Within this repository you will find a selection of programes in Python, R and LaTeX. The CATAM (Computater-aided teaching of all mathematics) folder contains university projects and reports exploring various topics. Note the third year ones are still currently in progress. In the WTKLAB lab folder you will find various programs I wrote during my internship with in the Department of Pharmacology, Cambridge. The data used for these programs belongs to the lab and so I have not included here so of course the programs will not run.
