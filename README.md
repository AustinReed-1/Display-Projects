Display Projects

Within this repository you will find a selection of programes in Python, R and LaTeX. Within the WTKLAB lab folder, you will find various programs I wrote during my internship at the Department of Pharmacology, Cambridge. The data used for these programs belongs to the lab and so I have not included here so of course the code will unfortunately not run. The CATAM (Computer-aided teaching of all mathematics) folder contains university projects and reports exploring various topics. Note the third year ones are still currently in progress (Bioinformatics project now complete!). In the CUAI Workshops file you will find a convolutional neural network which shows high accuracy and precision in correctly classifying images into categories of plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck.
