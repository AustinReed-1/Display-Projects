Display Projects

Within this repository you will find a selection of programes in Python, R and LaTeX. Within the WTKLAB lab folder, you will find various programs I wrote during my internship at the Department of Pharmacology, Cambridge. The data used for these programs belongs to the lab and so I have not included here so of course the code will unfortunately not run. The CATAM (Computer-aided teaching of all mathematics) folder contains one of my final year university projects exploring protein sequence comparisons for which I recieved full marks in (40/40). In the CUAI Workshops file you will find a convolutional neural network which shows high accuracy and precision in correctly classifying images into categories of plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck.
